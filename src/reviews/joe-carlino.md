I did a lot of research before deciding on Devschool. From a pragmatic standpoint, I'm receiving hundreds of hours of personalized education, a personalized education plan, and constant support for a very fair price. On a more personal level, I spoke to Jim for like 20 minutes and I quickly realized that I wanted to enroll.
